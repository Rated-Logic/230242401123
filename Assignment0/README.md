# Data mining is often described as the whole knowledge discovery process in industries , in media , and in research enviorments because of the following reasons
# 1. it is the most visible part that is because it is where the actual patern extractions happens , it is where the algrithms detects trends , clusters , predictions , anomalies.
# 2. It is a step that involves technically complex activity sguch as machine learning algorithm statistical modelling pattern recognition. In which the indusrty and the media highlight this complexity as the actual attaining of the knowledge discovery process
# 3. lack of boundary awareness among practitioners unable to distinguish between Data cleaning , data transformation , pattern discovery they see all as one process call it data mining 

# QN 2. Differences between data wragling , scaning and filtering in data minining
# i. Data wrangling also know as data pre processing it is the process of cleaning, transforming and preparing raw data into a usable format for minning
## it involves the following activities handling , missing data, removing duplicates, correcting inconsistencies , normalization / standardization , converting data types 
# ii. Scanning this is the process of examining , traversing the data to understand its structure , and collecting the metadata. its main purpose is to understand the dataset before applying algorithms
# Filtering is the process of excluding specific records or attributes from a given dataset based on its a certain creteria
